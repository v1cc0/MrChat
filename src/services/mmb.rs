/// MediaMetadataBroadcastService is a trait that can be implemented by services that wish to
/// display information about the currently playing track. When the currently playing track
/// changes, the service will be provided with the track's metadata, duration, and current
/// playback position.
///
/// The service is responsible for displaying this information in the appropriate manner. For
/// example, a service providing desktop integration should update immediately, while a service
/// that provides scrobbling functionality might want to wait some time before recording the
/// scrobble.
///
/// Note that MMBS operations can be performed on the UI thread, and thus services should not
/// perform substantial blocking operations in their MMBS implementations. If, for example, a
/// network request is needed, use an async function to perform the request.
