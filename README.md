## Architecture

MrChat is built on a modular architecture with three main components:

- **`src/chat/`** - AI chat functionality
- **`src/player/`** - Music player functionality
- **`src/shared/`** - Shared utilities and UI components

See `docs/chat_player_architecture.md` for detailed design documentation.

## Known Issues

- Symphonia MP3 decoder may output `invalid main_data_begin` warnings for some files (does not affect playback)
- See `docs/turso_database_issues.md` for Turso-specific known issues and workarounds

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- Code is formatted with `rustfmt`
- No new compiler warnings (unused code warnings are acceptable for WIP features)
- Changes work on Linux and macOS (Windows testing is appreciated but not required)
